# Weight Balance

A 3D physics-based puzzle game where players stack weighted cubes to build stable towers. Challenge yourself to create stable structures while managing weight distribution in real-time physics simulation.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/weight-balance.git
cd weight-balance
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` to start playing!

## How to Play

- **Click** on platform or cube surfaces to place cubes
- **Drag** mouse to orbit camera around your tower
- **Scroll** mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **Build** stable towers using all provided cubes
- **Restart** when your tower falls

## Current Status
ðŸš§ **Minimal Physics Prototype (v0.1.0)** - Basic physics simulation and cube placement

### What's Working
- âœ… 3D physics simulation with Cannon-es
- âœ… Cube placement system
- âœ… Camera orbit controls
- âœ… Restart functionality
- âœ… Weight-based cube visualization

### What's Coming Next
- ðŸ”„ Level progression system
- ðŸ”„ Rating system (stability + efficiency)
- ðŸ”„ Multiple platform types
- ðŸ”„ Advanced win conditions

## Tech Stack
- **Three.js** - 3D rendering and scene management
- **Cannon-es** - Physics simulation
- **Vite** - Development server and bundling
- **JavaScript** - Core language

## Development Roadmap
See [docs/TASKS.md](docs/TASKS.md) for detailed implementation plan.
